I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University, advised by **Prof. Pilsung Kang** in the Data Science and Business Analytics Lab. My research centers on building reliable natural language processing systems that are safe, privacy-aware, and evaluation-ready for real-world deployment.

My broader interests span:

- LLM evaluation frameworks that capture human checklists
- Privacy-preserving interfaces for large language models
- Efficient reasoning and rationale compression for text generation

I enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to turn research prototypes into practical tools. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together.

I also co-organize an NLP paper review study group called **Unknown NLP**. We publish our session write-ups publicly at [unknown-nlp.github.io](https://unknown-nlp.github.io) so that other researchers and practitioners can follow along and join the discussion.
