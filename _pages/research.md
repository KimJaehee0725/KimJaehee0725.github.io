## Research Focus

- **Privacy-Preserving LLM Interfaces**: Designing interaction pipelines that protect sensitive information while preserving task performance. Current work explores AlienLM, a framework for alienizing requests before they reach remote APIs.
- **Reliable Evaluation for Text Generation**: Building checklists and rubric-driven systems such as *CheckEval* that calibrate LLM judgments with human expectations.
- **Efficient Reasoning and Rationale Compression**: Investigating how to retain faithfulness while reducing verbosity in generated rationales for both zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings.

## Data Science and Business Analytics Lab

I am a member of the [Data Science and Business Analytics Lab](https://dsbal.snu.ac.kr) led by Prof. Pilsung Kang. We collaborate on projects spanning trustworthy AI, healthcare analytics, and user-centered evaluation methodologies.

### Current Projects

- **AlienLM** — A privacy-aware adapter for third-party LLM APIs that obfuscates personally identifiable information without hurting downstream utility.
- **Checklist-Guided Evaluation** — Extending *CheckEval* to multi-lingual domains and aligning expert checklists with crowdsourced signals.
- **Rationale Efficiency** — Developing sentence-level pruning methods for long-form reasoning models that balance interpretability with inference cost.
