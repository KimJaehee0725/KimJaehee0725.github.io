## Research Focus

- **Industry-Ready LLM Agents**: Building multi-agent pipelines, orchestration layers, and RAG systems that can operate safely in enterprise manufacturing and service environments.
- **Reliable Evaluation for Text Generation**: Designing checklist-driven, finance-grade evaluation frameworks such as *CheckEval* that align LLM outputs with domain experts.
- **Efficient Learning and Reasoning**: Crafting integrated NLU/NLG training strategies and rationale-efficient methods that keep inference tractable without sacrificing faithfulness.

## Data Science and Business Analytics Lab

I am a member of the [Data Science and Business Analytics Lab](https://dsbal.snu.ac.kr) led by Prof. Pilsung Kang. We collaborate on projects spanning trustworthy AI, healthcare analytics, and user-centered evaluation methodologies.
